            <h3>This webpage is a HTML webpage!</h3>
            <h3>That means that this webpage was made by using the code language HTML!</h3>
            <h3>HTML is a great language because you can code webpages and do anything you want with the your webpage!</h3>
            <h3>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</h3>
            <h3>HTML also goes along with 2 other coding languages called CSS and JavaScript.</h3>
            <h3>CSS is how you style your webpage and color it. CSS's full form is Cascading Style Sheets.</h3>
            <h3>JavaScript is how you can make buttons and other things to interact with your webpage.</h3>
            <h3>There is also a component called the console. The console is for testing purposes.</h3>
            <h3>You can go to the console of any webpage by right clicking on the webpage and clicking inspect.</h3>
            <h3>To print something onto the console in HTML you need to create a script tag.</h3>
            <h3>To create a script tag, you need to make 2 angular brackets like this &lt;&gt;. Inside them, write script.</h3>
            <h3>Then you can print something on the console by creating a variable like this: var = you can write anything you want here.</h3>
            <h3>Then to print it onto the console, you can do: console.log(var).</h3>
            <h3>Another way you can print words in the console is: console.log("You can write whatever you want to print in the console here.")</h3>
            <h3>Now you can open up the console on this webpage and see what is written in there.</h3>
            <script>console.log("You made it to the console tab!")</script>
